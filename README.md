# Dotfiles

This repository contains the dot and nix files that build into my system with my
preferences. Instructions on how to reproduce my configuration are below.

## Directory Structure

The `system/` directory contain `configuration.nix` and
`hardware-configuration.nix` files for building my system. Note that
`hardware-configuration.nix` is automatically generated by your system if using
NixOS. To generate it manually,
[check out the command](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixos-generate-config)
`nixos-generate-config`.

Most other directories at the root level are the config folders for applications
I use (like Hyprland, Yazi, etc). These are symlinked to their correct locations
(typically in `~/.config/...`) by Home Manager (see
[`home.nix`](https://github.com/piyushkumbhare/dotfiles/blob/master/home.nix#L21))

For this repository, a function called `homelink` is defined which makes a call
to `config.lib.file.mkOutOfStoreSymlink`. While impure, this allows config files
(like `hypr/hyprland.conf`) to be hot-reloaded upon file save, rather than
requiring a system rebuild.

## Building

### System

Both the system and home-manager configurations are built and managed through
Nix Flakes.

To build, first clone the repo:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:zSuperx/dotfiles.git
...
$ cd dotfiles
```

Then, granted you have [flake support enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes)
in NixOS, you can just run the standard rebuild command but with the flake
argument:

```console
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ./dotfiles
```

### Neovim

Since I use NVF to manage Neovim, its options, and its plugins, the following
command can be used to launch my Neovim config. Great for testing it out!

```console
nix run github:zSuperx/dotfiles#neovim
```
