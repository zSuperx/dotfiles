# Dotfiles

This repository contains the dot and nix files that build into my system with my
preferences. Instructions on how to reproduce my configuration are below.

(Credits are at the end)

## Directory Structure

The `nixos/` directory contain `.nix` files for building my system. Note that
`hardware-configuration.nix` is automatically generated by your system if using
NixOS. To generate it manually,
[check out the command](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixos-generate-config)
`nixos-generate-config`.

Most other directories at the root level are the config folders for applications
I use (like Hyprland, Yazi, etc). These are symlinked to their correct locations
(typically in `~/.config/...`) by Home Manager. See
[`nixos/home.nix`](https://github.com/piyushkumbhare/dotfiles/blob/master/nixos/home.nix#L21)
to see how it's implemented in the general case.

For this repository, a function called `homelink` is defined which makes a call
to `config.lib.file.mkOutOfStoreSymlink`. This allows the config files (like
`hypr/hyprland.conf`) to be hot-reloaded upon file save, rather than requiring a
system rebuild.

## Building

Both the system and home-manager configurations are built and managed through
Nix Flakes.

To build, first clone the repo:

```console
git clone git@github.com:piyushkumbhare/dotfiles.git
```

Then, granted you have [flake support enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes)
in NixOS, you can just run the standard rebuild command but with the flake
argument:

```console
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ./dotfiles/nixos
```

I am not a creative person lol. Here are the links I took some configs or
inspiration from:
